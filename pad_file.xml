Encrypt with your personal photo or video file
</Char_Desc_80>
<Char_Desc_250>
FinalCrypt is a file encryption program that encrypts (large) files in a completely different way. FinalCrypt uses (large) cipher files, which can be any unique file like a personal photo or video. Unbreakable encryption without your cipher file.

<Char_Desc_450>
FinalCrypt is a file encryption program that encrypts (large) files in a completely different way. FinalCrypt uses (large) cipher files, which can be any unique file like a personal photo or video. Conventional encryption software uses relatively small key(file)s to encrypt and decrypt files by means of virtually incomprehensible mathematics leaving you completely in the dark about true safety. FinalCrypt encryption therefore is unbreakable.

<Char_Desc_2000>
FinalCrypt is a file encryption program that encrypts (large) files in a completely different way. FinalCrypt uses (large) cipher files, which can be any unique file like a personal photo or video. Conventional encryption software uses relatively small key(file)s to encrypt and decrypt files by means of incomprehensible mathematics (to most people) leaving you completely in the dark about true safety. FinalCrypt's power relies on the uniqueness of your personal cipher file that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. FinalCrypt encrypts your data-files with all the unique data in your cipher file. The enormous amounts of unique bit patterns in your cipher file negate the bit patterns in your data files. Decrypting is simply done by encrypting your data files again with the same unique cipher. No supercomputer can brute-force attack generate a cipher file that looks just like your secret personal photo or video file. Therefore security and secrecy is guaranteed for as long as you keep your cipher file secret! FinalCrypt supports raw cipher devices on Linux and Apple OSX (e.g. on USB mem sticks etc.) to safeguard your ciphers more securely. On top of cipher devices, optional password injection will be introduced to further protect personal cipher files.

<h1>FinalCrypt - Powerful file encryption utility</h1> There is no shortage of file encryption utilities, so you can't say there is no reasonable way of protecting your data. However, if you are looking for an airtight protection solution, then you should definitely turn to FinalCrypt. It encrypts your files as you would expect from any similar application, but this one comes with a unique twist. Rather than using passwords and phrases to generate keys, which can be cracked eventually, the software uses unique bit data from your photos and videos. This means that your files will be virtually uncrackable, since replicating a photo perfectly is impossible. 

FinalCrypt is offered completely free of charge and it can be used on any modern Windows platform. It doesn't take long to install it and you don't have to go through a complex procedure. The hardware requirements are modest and there is no need to meet any special requirements. 

In terms of appearance, FinalCrypt can be confused with a simple file manager. It features a twin-panel file browser, with all the controls you need to navigate comfortably through your folders. Encrypting a file is an effortless task. All you have to do is select the file you wish to encrypt on the left panel and the image or video you want to use as a cipher on the right panel and hit the "Encrypt" button, in the lower region of the interface, where you will also find options for pausing and stopping the process. Decrypting files is done exactly the same. Just select the encrypted file and its cipher, click the same button and the software will take care of the rest. 

The software is capable of encrypting huge amounts of data, so you can protect any important files, regardless of their size. The encrypted file will be given a .bit extension, which are impossible to access. If you attempt to open such a file, the operating system won't know what application to use for that particular file.

Because it uses images or videos to generate encryption keys, your file's protection will be impossible to break. No system in the world can truly replicate a picture. Even the slightest shift in color or tone can make all the difference between the correct cipher file and a fake. For example, drawing a pixel-sized dot in an image will make it a unique cipher file. 

When it comes to protecting private files, you can expect nothing less than ironclad encryption capabilities from FinalCrypt. 

Pros:
The software uses personal image and videofiles to encryption personal files. The smallest modification in an image can make all the difference between correct and incorrect cipher files. The application is free, it doesn't use too many resources and it is quite easy to use.

Cons:
There are no obvious drawbacks to complain about.
