  summary: Encryption program with strong Personal Cipher Encryption
  description: |
    FinalCrypt encrypts your files with a personal cipher file (a personal photo or video).
  Personal Cipher Encryption can not be cracked, as personal ciphers are too large to be
  brute force attacked and too personal to be corrupted or backdoored by others.
