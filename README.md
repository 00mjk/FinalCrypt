# FinalCrypt

FinalCrypt uses a big personal (photo or video) file (a so called "cipher") to encrypt your data.
Traditional encryption software only use (AES 256 byte keys). Even clustered supercomputers can't
guess all the combinations to regenerate your personal holiday photo or video, so that's why it's called "FinalCrypt", because encrypting is truly final.

One more reason to not trust standard encryption algorithms:
