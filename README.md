# FinalCrypt

FinalCrypt a file encryption program that encrypts large data files with large cipher files. The unique approach used here is that cipher keys are replaced by much larger cipher files like a unique personal photo or video that only you have and used to toggle the bits in your data file with the unique bit patterns in your cipher file. No supercomputer can bruteforce attack generate a cipher file that looks just like your secret personal photo or video file, so security guaranteed
