# FinalCrypt

FinalCrypt encrypts your files with any (personal photo or video) file.
A so called "cipher file". Even supercomputers can't reproduce your photo or video out of thin air.
Why FinalCrypt? Virtually all encryption software uses small (32 bytes) key files to (AES) encrypt your data.
FinalCrypt's "Personal Cipher Encryption" is unbreakable, fully OpenSource and guaranteed to be free of malware or backdoors!
