# FinalCrypt

FinalCrypt encrypts your files with a personal cipher file (a personal photo or video). Personal Cipher Encryption can't be cracked
as personal ciphers are too large to be brute force attacked and too personal to be corrupted or backdoored by others. Government approved
encryption standards like DES / RSA / AES deliberately limit key file size (2048 bits / 256 bytes) misleading the public they are safe.
