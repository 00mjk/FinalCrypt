# FinalCrypt

FinalCrypt uses a big personal (photo or video) file (a so called "cipher") to encrypt your data.
Traditional encryption software uses relatively small and weak (AES-256 byte keys) to encrypt.
Even clustered supercomputers can't guess all the possible combinations to regenerate your
personal holiday photo, so that's why it's called "FinalCrypt"; Encrypting is truly Final.

One more reason to not trust standard encryption algorithms:
