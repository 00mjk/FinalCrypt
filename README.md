# FinalCrypt

FinalCrypt a file encryption program that encrypts (large) files in a completely different way.
FinalCrypt uses (large) cipher files, which can be any unique file like a personal photo or video.
Conventional encryption software uses relatively small key(files) to encrypt and decrypt files by means of incomprehensible mathematics (to most people) leaving you completely in the dark about true safety.
FinalCrypt's power relies on the uniqueness of your personal cipher file that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. FinalCrypt encrypts your data-files with all the unique data in your cipher file.
The enormous amounts of unique bit patterns in your cipher file negate the bit patters in your data files. Decryption requires repeating the process with exactly the same unique cipher file data.
No supercomputer can brute-force attack generate a cipher file that looks just like your secret personal photo or video file, so security and secrecy guaranteed for as long as you keep your cipher file secret!
