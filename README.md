# FinalCrypt

FinalCrypt is a file encryption program that encrypts (large) files in a completely different way.
FinalCrypt uses (large) cipher files, which can be any unique file like a personal photo or video.
Conventional encryption software uses relatively small key(file)s to encrypt and decrypt files
by means of incomprehensible mathematics (to most people) leaving you completely in the dark about true safety.
FinalCrypt's power relies on the uniqueness of your personal cipher file that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.
FinalCrypt encrypts your data-files with all the unique data in your cipher file.
The enormous amounts of unique bit patterns in your cipher file negate the bit patterns in your data files.
Decrypting is simply done by encrypting your data files again with the same unique cipher.
No supercomputer can brute-force attack generate a cipher file that looks just like your secret personal photo or video file.
Therefore security and secrecy is guaranteed for as long as you keep your cipher file secret!
FinalCrypt supports raw cipher partitions on Linux and Apple OSX (e.g. on USB mem sticks etc.) to safeguard your ciphers more securely. 
On top of raw ciphers, optional password injection will be introduced to further protect possibly exposed personal ciphers.
