FinalCrypt uses symmetric One Time Pad Encryption which	is known as the most unbreakable encryption in existence.

FinalCrypt's large true random "One Time Pad" (FIPS140-2 & RFC4086 compliant) Keys are mathematically unbreakable.
The Shor's algorithm has proven that all asymmetric encryption will instantly be broken by Quantum Computers (or simulators).

Full Disk Encryption doesn't offer real security. A Virus, spying or indexing software can read all your files when you login / unlock your drive.
