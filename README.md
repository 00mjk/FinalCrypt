FinalCrypt uses symmetric One Time Pad Encryption which is known as the most unbreakable encryption in existence.

FinalCrypt's large true random "One Time Pad" (FIPS140-2 & RFC4086 compliant) Keys are mathematically unbreakable.
The Shor's algorithm has proven that all asymmetric encryption will instantly be broken by Quantum Computers (or simulators).
Full Disk Encryption doesn't offer much security either, since a virus, spying or indexing software can read all your files in an unlocked drive.
FinalCrypt is the only One Time Pad, Bulk File Encryption Software, that is freely available to the public.
