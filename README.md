# FinalCrypt

FinalCrypt encrypts your files with a personal cipher file (a personal photo or video).
Personal Cipher Encryption can't be cracked, as personal ciphers are too large to be
brute force attacked and too personal to be corrupted or backdoored by others.
Encryption standards like DES / RSA / AES use insanely small key files (max 256 bytes).
