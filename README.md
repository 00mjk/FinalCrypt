# FinalCrypt

FinalCrypt encrypts & decrypts your data with a personal (cipher) file like your personal photo or video.
Virtually all encryption software uses very small public / private key files (Rijndael based encryption lik: AES and DES).
A FinalCrypt cipher file can be much larger (GigaBytes even), which makes it infinitely more hard to bruteforce attack (crack)
as no supercomputer cluster can try all the combinations to recreate your holiday photo or video.

FinalCrypt encryption is unbreakable without your personal cipher.
